## üìã Executive Summary

This project implements a comprehensive machine learning pipeline to predict student final grades using demographic, social, and academic features. Through rigorous data analysis and modeling, the system achieved **82.1% accuracy (R¬≤ = 0.821)** in predicting student outcomes, identifying key factors that influence academic success and providing actionable insights for educational interventions.

The analysis processes 1,044 student records across Mathematics and Portuguese language courses, demonstrating the power of data science in educational settings. The final model serves as an early warning system, flagging 32% of at-risk students with 95.3% recall and 61.2% precision.

## üéØ Project Overview

### Objectives
- Predict student final grades (G3) with high accuracy across two academic subjects
- Identify critical factors influencing student academic performance  
- Develop an early warning system for proactive educational intervention
- Create actionable insights for resource allocation and support strategies

### Key Results
- **Best Model**: Gradient Boosting Regressor with R¬≤ = 0.821, RMSE = 1.592
- **Feature Insights**: Prior academic performance (G1, G2) and study habits are strongest predictors
- **Business Impact**: Early warning system identifies 95.3% of at-risk students for targeted intervention

## üìä Dataset Description

**Source**: UCI Student Performance Dataset  
**Size**: 1,044 student records (395 Math, 649 Portuguese)  
**Features**: 33 original features across multiple categories:

- **Academic Features**: Previous grades (G1, G2), study time, past failures
- **Demographic Features**: Age, gender, urban/rural address, family size
- **Socio-Economic Features**: Parent education levels, family jobs, support systems
- **Behavioral Features**: Social activities, alcohol consumption, relationships

**Target Variable**: Final grade (G3) on a 0-20 scale

## üîÑ Project Pipeline

### 1. Data Loading & Quality Assessment
- Combined Mathematics and Portuguese datasets
- Verified data integrity (no missing values, no duplicates)
- Initial statistical profiling and distribution analysis

### 2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- **Grade Distribution Analysis**: Portuguese students show slightly higher performance
- **Correlation Analysis**: Strong correlation between prior grades (G1, G2) and final outcomes
- **Feature Relationships**: Identified key patterns in study habits, failures, and social factors
- **Interactive Visualizations**: Comprehensive dashboard showing performance drivers

### 3. Feature Engineering & Preprocessing
- **New Features Created**:
  - `total_alcohol`: Combined weekday and weekend alcohol consumption
  - `at_risk`: Binary indicator based on multiple risk factors
- **Preprocessing Pipeline**:
  - StandardScaler for numerical features
  - OneHotEncoder for categorical variables
  - Proper handling of nominal vs. binary features
- **Train-Test Split**: 80-20 split with stratification on risk factors

### 4. Model Development & Training
**Models Evaluated**:
- Linear Regression (baseline)
- Random Forest Regressor
- Gradient Boosting Regressor

**Model Selection**: Gradient Boosting chosen based on cross-validation performance

### 5. Model Evaluation & Validation
- **Performance Metrics**: R¬≤, RMSE, MAE
- **Cross-Validation**: 5-fold CV to ensure model stability
- **Residual Analysis**: Diagnostic plots to assess model assumptions

### 6. Model Interpretation & Feature Importance
- Feature importance analysis for business insights
- Prediction vs. actual performance visualization
- Residual analysis for model diagnostics

### 7. Business Impact Analysis
- Early warning system evaluation (precision, recall, specificity)
- Resource allocation optimization insights
- Actionable recommendations for educational stakeholders

## üèÜ Model Performance

| Model | R¬≤ Score | RMSE | MAE | CV R¬≤ Mean | CV R¬≤ Std |
|-------|----------|------|-----|------------|-----------|
| **Gradient Boosting** | **0.821** | **1.592** | **1.188** | **0.870** | **0.023** |
| Linear Regression | 0.819 | 1.601 | 1.196 | 0.833 | 0.027 |
| Random Forest | 0.808 | 1.651 | 1.238 | 0.860 | 0.025 |

### Early Warning System Performance
- **Precision**: 61.2% (of flagged students who are actually at-risk)
- **Recall**: 95.3% (of at-risk students successfully identified)
- **Specificity**: 84.3% (of not-at-risk students correctly ignored)

## üîç Key Insights

### Critical Success Factors
1. **Prior Academic Performance**: Previous grades (G1, G2) are the strongest predictors
2. **Study Habits**: Weekly study time shows significant positive correlation
3. **Academic History**: Past failures have strong negative impact on outcomes
4. **Family Support**: Parental education and family support systems matter
5. **Social Factors**: Excessive social activities correlate with lower performance

### Actionable Recommendations
- **Early Intervention**: Deploy model predictions after first grading period
- **Targeted Support**: Focus resources on students with past failures
- **Study Skills Training**: Implement workshops for effective study techniques
- **Parental Engagement**: Enhance communication with families of at-risk students
